//Bob needs a fast way to calculate the volume of a cuboid with three values: the length, width and height of the //cuboid. Write a function to help Bob with this calculatiion

function bobBuilder (l,w,h){
    //p: intergers as length width and height for cuboidal
    //r: the volume of the cuboid
    //e: given (300,210,90) = vol
    //p: formula for volume of cube l * w * h
    let result = l*w*h
    return result
